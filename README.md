HTML webpage with cooking recipes

This project is for HTML implementation, the main intention is to use the knowledge obtained in HTML lesson, Git and best practices commit changes.

We mainly put in practice the HTML tags, elements and content practiced in the foundations stage of the Odin project.

I must be able to easily use the tags, elements and different type of tools provided directly from HTML to setup a recipe webpage, this stage is only for HTML and the final page may seem rusty.
