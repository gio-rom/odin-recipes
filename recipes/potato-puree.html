        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Yellow potatoes: 4 pcs</li>
            <li>Butter: 200 grams</li>
            <li>Milk: 1 cup</li>
            <li>Cream: 1/4 cup</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Wash the potatoes very well and cut them in half horizontally. The potato halves should be very similar in size so they cook evenly. Put them in a large enough pot and cover with cold water, about 1 inch of water above the potatoes. Add 1/2 tablespoon of coarse salt for every 1 quarter of water in the pan.</li>
            <li>Once the water reaches boiling point, lower the heat to low medium and simmer the potatoes uncovered for about 20 minutes or until the blade of a knife inserted in the potato goes easily through it.</li>
            <li>Work quickly with the potatoes still hot - Drain the potatoes, put half a potato in your potato ricer using the disk with smaller wholes, potato skin side up. Press the potato into a pan, release the handles, open and remove the skin left inside. Continue with the remaining potatoes. If using a food mill, peel the potatoes before milling them.</li>
            <li>Put the pan over medium heat and stir vigourously for 4 minutes with a wooden spatula, letting any excess water evaporate. Start adding the small pieces of cold butter, little by little, incorporating very well and stirring vigourously (no need to go to the gym tonight!). Again, don't stress over the amount of butter, it's still less caloric then french fries and once you try theis purée you will taste the difference.</li>
            <li>Bring the milk and the cream to a boil and add in a stream to the potato mix, until completely absorbed. Depending on the moisture level of your potatoes you might need to adjust the quantity of milk, you don't want a solid purée nor a runny one. So go slowly at the end to make sure you get the right consistency. If you need to add more milk, make sure you add it hot.</li>
            <li>Check the seasoning - salt only. This classic French purée does not have pepper, nutmeg or any herbs added to it.</li>
            <li>Put the purée in a bain-marie to keep warm, adding a little butter over the purée so it doesn't form a dry skin.</li>
            <li>Serve the purée as a side dish for fish like sole meunière, chicken and braised meat.</li>
